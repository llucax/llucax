# License Declaration of Intent

Revision: 1

The main goal of the license chosen for this project is to protect user's
right. There is a second goal, very hard to convey, which is to protect my
ability (as developer behind the project) to sustain myself by finding ways to
make a living with my work.

I read a lot and tried to find suitable licenses to achieve the second goal,
and I couldn't find any clear option. I like, in principle, what
[Fair-Code](https://faircode.io/) is about, and really thought of using [The
Commons Clause](https://commonsclause.com/), but there seem to be holes around
it and end up being too restrictive or ambiguous (an interesting analysis can
be found
[here](https://www.finnegan.com/en/insights/articles/why-open-source-licenses-with-a-commons-clause-may-become-less-common.html)).
Also many companies using them moved to custom licenses.

I don't have the resources to write a good license that expresses what
I consider a fair use, so I will put it right here as a (non-legally binding)
declaration of intent and use a standard [open
source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Initiative) or
[*copyleft*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft) license, well known to
users. It is also a way to keep committed to FLOSS, in which I always believed
to be the right way to write and distribute software. It would feel bad if I
have to use a non-FLOSS license.

The user-protection part is well coverered by the license itself, as open
source and *copyleft* licenses have
a long and proved history. What is more difficult is to express the limitations
one want to apply so they don't affect other rights and uses that I consider
fair to allow me to make a living out my development efforts.

If at some point I feel my ability to make a living out of the software is at
risk because of what I consider unfair uses of it, I will consider picking
a different license. But I hope that never happens...

When in doubt, I encourage you to always get in touch (luca-license@llucax.com).

## Fair use

* Any personal or internal use. By "personal" I mean people and by "internal"
  I mean companies using it to build something on top that is not just selling
  or monetizing the software itself. Of course in this case it would be even
  more fair to contribute back to the software (moneraily or with improvements,
  bug reports, translation, development infrastructure, offering support to
  other users, etc.), specially if it's user in a for-profit fashion.
* Offering the software as 1-click install in PaaS and cloud providers, is also
  fair, even if it comes with a fee for the hosting and associated services
  (again, the user should have the freedom to self-host the software if they
  are really concerned about privacy and these kind of services just makes it
  easy for them to do so).

## Unfair use

* Offering the software as a service without prior notice, as long as I am also
  doing so. In other words, competing with what could be my main source of
  income to be able to continue developing this software. I say "Without prior
  notice" because if I'm doing well and/or the service is only covering for
  some audience or use cases where my service is not the best choice, I stil
  believe competition is fair. The goal here is not to have an absolute
  monopoly, specially with small providers, serving a small group of users,
  there's usually enough fish in the see for everyone. The goal here is to
  protect my investment to be able to make a living, and after that even
  protect other small providers that want to contribute back and sustain their
  living with this. Or put another way, avoid big cloud players, with their
  significant low-cost advantage, to get the monopoly for themselves (specially
  in cases where there is no plan to contribute back).

## Edge cases

* Proving the software as a service for free to an unlimited amount of users is
  a hard case. It definitely goes well with making easy for users to use the
  software, but it might completely evaporate my source of income, and thus
  stop development, which is then bad for users. If you plan to do this, please
  do get in touch so we can see if there a way to make it happen.
