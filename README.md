![Me](llucax.jpg)

Hi! I'm a software developer that loves Free/Open Source Software and is
trying to make a living out of it. I've been involved in FOSS for more than 20
years now. I've founded local Linux users groups and contributed to FOSS
projects and wrote a few myself. Please check my [GitHub Sponsors
page](https://github.com/sponsors/llucax) for more details about me.

If you want to support me, I can accept sponsoring via these platforms (from
the most preferred to the less preferred):
