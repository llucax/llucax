![Me](llucax.jpg)

Hi! I'm a software developer that loves Free/Open Source Software and is
trying to make a living out of it. I've been involved in FOSS for more than 20
years now. I've founded local Linux users groups and contributed to FOSS
projects and wrote a few myself. Please check my [GitHub Sponsors
page](https://github.com/sponsors/llucax) for more details about me.

If you want to check my (past) contributions, I also have (had) other GitHub
work account from which I also contribute(d) to FLOSS projects:

* At [Sociomantic](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sociomantic-labs),
  then acquired by [Dunnhumby](https://www.dunnhumby.com/):
  https://github.com/leandro-lucarella-sociomantic  **(deactivated)**

  Here I was in charge of the FLOSS programme,
  [Sociomantic Tsunami](https://github.com/sociomantic-tsunami/), which
  outlived the company.

* At (The) [Podcast App](https://podcast.app/):
  https://github.com/lucatpa **(deactivated)**

* At [Frequenz](https://frequenz.com):
  https://github.com/leandro-lucarella-frequenz
  
  Also leading the FLOSS efforts.
