<p>
Hi! I'm a software developer that loves
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software"
target="_blank">Open Source</a> (and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"
target="_blank">Free/Libre Software</a> even better).
</p>

<p>
<b>Please note that preferred way to receive support is via
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/llucax" target="_blank">GitHub
Sponsors</a></b> (this <a href="https://github.com/llucax/llucax/blob/main/sponsoring-platforms.md" target="_blank">explains
why</a>). Nevertheless it is, of course, up to you which platform to use.
</p>

<h2 class="western">üëã A bit about me</h2>
<p>
I've been involved in FOSS for more than 20 years (since the end of the 90s).
I've founded local Linux users groups and contributed to FOSS projects and
wrote a few myself.
</p>

<h2 class="western">üèóÔ∏è What am I working on</h2>
<p>
I guess if you reached this page, you already know some project I'm working on
(or have worked on) and you want to support that, but in the off-chance that
you are just an angel out there looking at random developers to support, you
can check <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/llucax" target="_blank">my
profile in GitHub Sponsors</a> for more details.
</p>

<h2 class="western">üíñ Sponsoring my work</h2>
<p>
I always made a living on software development, and always tried to keep as
much of the software I write open source. But I also always worked as an
employee in a company, as it is not always easy with companies that struggle to
see the value of open sourcing code.
</p>

<p>
I feel it is time to make a jump and at least try to make a living while doing
open source, and writing meaningful software. I know it will be a hard jump,
and that failure is very likely, but hey, I have to try, and I will be
eternally thankful if you can sponsor my work.
</p>

<p>
I'm currently accepting sponsorship using the following platforms:
</p>

</p>

<p>
This is just to make supporter's lives easier. If you already use a sponsoring
platform, I don't want to force you to sign-up to another one.
</p>

<p>
You should bear in mind that different platforms have different features and
fees (so in the above list are sorted by preference order). Currently the only
platform that have <strong>zero</strong> fees is
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/llucax">GitHub Sponsors</a>,
so if you can, please use that one (but it doesn't currently have an option for
one-time payments). If you want to know exactly what are the features and fees
of different platforms, you can have a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/llucax/llucax/blob/main/sponsoring-platforms.md">summary</a>
I compiled.
