### üëã A bit about me

**Please note that my preferred way to receive support is via** [![GitHub
Sponsors](https://img.shields.io/badge/-GitHub%20Sponsors-ea4aaa?logo=github)](https://github.com/sponsors/llucax).
Nevertheless it is, of course, up to you which platform to use. More details at
the bottom.

Hi! I'm a software developer that loves [Open
Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) (and [Free/Libre
Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) even better).

I'm from Argentina but moved to Berlin (Germany) in 2011. My idea was to stay
for 6 months, maximum 1 year, but hey, plans change. Now I made my life here
(wife and daughter included) so I guess I will be staying for a while üôÇ

I've been involved in FOSS for more than 20 years (since the end of the 90s).
I've founded local Linux users groups and contributed to FOSS projects and
wrote a few myself. I always did my best to convince my employers about the
value of open source, and succeeded to publish some stuff I wrote on almost
every company I worked for. Probably the one with the biggest impact was the
[Sociomantic Tsunami](https://github.com/sociomantic-tsunami/) open source
program. We produced around 35 open source projects including a [GitHub CLI
tool](https://github.com/sociomantic-tsunami/git-hub), a [bunch of
D programming language
libraries](https://github.com/sociomantic-tsunami?language=d) and [javascript
libraries](https://github.com/sociomantic-tsunami?language=javascript) too. The
program even outlived the company, now it's fully managed by the community and
some of the projects are still active.

### üèóÔ∏è What am I working on

I guess if you reached this page, you already know some project I'm working on
(or have worked on) and you want to support that, but in the off-chance that
you are just an angel out there looking at random developers to support, you
can check out the following sites where I publish my work:

* [Home Page](https://llucax.com/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/llucax)
* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/llucax)
* [Dart/Flutter Pub](https://pub.dev/publishers/llucax.com/packages)
* [Python PyPi](https://pypi.org/user/llucax)
* [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/llucax) (not really development but
  maybe you want to sponsor some other creative work üôÉ)

I am the type of developer that when bumps into a bug in an open source
project, tries at the very least to make a good bug report, with a reduced test
case, and when possible even a patch. So I spend quite some time doing this,
a type of work that is not easy to showcase, but extremely important in my
opinion.

Currently I'm focusing on a media player app for toddlers and small children,
that it is safe and easy to use for them and easy to manage for parents. Also
privacy is a **big** goal. Besides the player, I want to provide parents with
a good content creation tool too, so they can create their own content (I know
my kid loves to look at family pictures and videos). The app is not published
yet, but I will do so when I have an MVP.

### üíñ Sponsoring my work

I always made a living on software development, and always tried to keep as
much of the software I write open source. But I also always worked as an
employee in a company, as it is not always easy with companies that struggle to
see the value of open sourcing code (while running 90% of open source software
to make profit, of course).

I feel it is time to make a jump and at least try to make a living while doing
open source, and writing meaningful software. I know it will be a hard jump,
and that failure is very likely, but hey, I have to try, and I will be
eternally thankful if you can sponsor my work.

I'm currently accepting sponsorship using the following platforms:

[![GitHub Sponsors](https://img.shields.io/badge/-GitHub%20Sponsors-ea4aaa?logo=github)](https://github.com/sponsors/llucax)
[![Liberapay](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Liberapay-f6c915?logo=liberapay&logoColor=black)](https://liberapay.com/llucax/donate)
[![Paypal](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Paypal-0070ba?logo=paypal)](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=UZRR3REUC4SY2)
[![Buy Me A Coffee](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Buy%20Me%20A%20Coffee-ff813f?logo=buy-me-a-coffee&logoColor=black)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/llucax)
[![Flattr](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Flattr-6bc76b?logo=flattr)](https://flattr.com/@llucax)

This is just to make supporter's lives easier. If you already use a sponsoring
platform, I don't want to force you to sign-up to another one.

You should bear in mind that different platforms have different features and
fees (so in the above list are sorted by preference order). Currently the only
platform that have **zero** fees is [GitHub
Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/llucax), so if you can, please use that
one (but it doesn't currently have an option for one-time payments). If you
want to know exactly what are the features and fees of different platforms, you
can have a look at the
[summary](https://github.com/llucax/llucax/blob/main/sponsoring-platforms.md)
I compiled.
