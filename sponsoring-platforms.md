This page is dedicate to explain with a bit more detail what are the available
sponsoring options if you want to sponsor me, and what are the features and
fee, or pros and cons.

If you are looking to know why I'm looking for sponsors and what I do, you can
check out my [GitHub Sponsors profile](https://github.com/sponsors/llucax).

## General notes

One of the main difference between some of the sponsoring platforms is they
accept one-time payments or recurring payments (weekly, monthly, yearly).

In general I much rather receive a small recurring sponsorship than a bigger
one-time one, as one of the big issues for people like me is reaching some
stability. Even when is nice to receive a big unexpected *gift* once in a while,
is hard to plan and make sure all the bills are paid this way.

Sponsoring platforms are listed ordered of preference (I prefer the most the
first one and the last the last one), either because of fees, features or how
much I (dis)like the platform ðŸ™ƒ.

## GitHub Sponsors [![GitHub Sponsors](https://img.shields.io/badge/-GitHub%20Sponsors-ea4aaa?logo=github)](https://github.com/sponsors/llucax)

[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors.) is my preferred platform, as it
takes **ZERO** fees (the only one so far). Not even transactions fees, so
**100%** of the money spent by sponsors reaches the people being sponsored, whic
is amazing!

* **ZERO** fees.
* It only supports recurring monthly payments, no one-time payments option.
* It only supports pre-defined amounts, no free amount option.
* It doesn't support micro-payments.
* Payment methods: Credit Card, Paypal (which in turn accepts many options).
* It requires a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
* More information: https://github.com/sponsors.

Fees examples:

* You spend 1$ - I receive 1$ (100%).

## Liberapay [![Liberapay](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Liberapay-f6c915?logo=liberapay&logoColor=black)](https://liberapay.com/llucax/)

[Liberapay](https://liberapay.com) is a non-profit and open sponsoring platform
focusing on long term support and privacy and transparency. For example, I can't
see who is sponsoring me via this platform.

* Fees vary by payment processor, payment method, countries and currencies.
  The average is expected to be below 5% in all cases (but Liberapay doesn't
  take a cut, it only charges processing fees).
  When paying with non European cards I think it should be around 2.9% + â‚¬0.25
  and when using Stripe as a processor with an European card, 1.4% + â‚¬0.25.

* It only supports recurring weekly, monthly and yearly payments. It doesn't
  support one-time payments but it has an option to manually renew the recurrent
  payments, so it can be effectively used for one-time payments with this in
  mind.
* It supports micro-payments (as low as 0.01â‚¬ per week), but it also has
  a maximum of 100â‚¬ per week). Also fees are expected to be relatively high for
  low amounts.
* Payments methods: Stripe, Paypal (both accept multiple options, like credit
  cards or bank transfer, depending on the country).
* It requires a [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com) account.
* It doesn't require an account.
* It can only be used for donations, meaning that transactions must not be
  linked to a contract nor a promise of recompense.
* More information: https://liberapay.com/about/faq

Fees examples (Liberapay doesn't give details, I'm getting the info from
[Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-de/pricing) and
[Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/fundraising), but I'm not sure
if these are the conditions that really apply):

* See Paypal for an example for non European cards or when using Paypal.
* You spend 1$ - I receive $0.74 (25% fee) with Stripe and European cards.
* You spend 10$ - I receive $9.61 (3.9% fee) with Stripe and European cards.
* You spend 100$ - I receive $98.37 (1.63% fee) with Stripe and European cards.

## Paypal [![Paypal](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Paypal-0070ba?logo=paypal)](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=UZRR3REUC4SY2)

[Paypal](https://www.paypal.com) is one of the most widespread and used online
payment platforms, and not really an sponsoring platform, but since it is
ubiquitous, it is always good to have it as an option. For small amounts, fees
are quite high, but for bigger amounts is reasonably low.

* 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction fee.
* Supports both one-time and recurring monthly payments.
* Supports pre-defined and free amounts.
* Micro-payments are not practical due to the high fees for small amounts.
* Payments methods: Credit card, bank account, etc. (depends on the country).
* It doesn't require an account (when paying with credit/debit card).
* More information: https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/fundraising

Fees examples:

* You spend 1$ - I receive 0.67$ (33% fee).
* You spend 10$ - I receive 9.42$ (5.8% fee).
* You spend 100$ - I receive 96.88$ (3.1% fee).

## Buy Me A Coffee [![Buy Me A Coffee](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Buy%20Me%20A%20Coffee-ff813f?logo=buy-me-a-coffee&logoColor=black)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/llucax)

[Buy Me A Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/) is similar to Liberapay, but it
is more focused on communities than privacy. For example, I get the information
of all my supporters and have tools to e-mail them. It also have the concept of
membership which is exclusive content for people having recurring payments.
I have this enabled but really offering anything valuable for now, just
a mention on the sponsors list in my home pages.

* 5% fixed per-transaction fee.
* Supports both one-time (the default) and recurring monthly or yearly payments
  (called membership).
* Supports pre-defined and free amounts (sort of, memberships have a fixes price
  and one-time payments are multiple of a minimum amount, in my case 3â‚¬).
* It doesn't support micro-payments.
* Payments methods: Stripe, Paypal (both accept multiple options, like credit
  cards or bank transfer, depending on the country).
* It doesn't require an account (when paying with credit/debit card).
* More information: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/about

Fees examples:

* You spend 1$ - I receive 0.95$ (5% fee).
* You spend 10$ - I receive 9.5$ (5% fee).
* You spend 100$ - I receive 95$ (5% fee).

## Flattr [![Flattr](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Flattr-6bc76b?logo=flattr)](https://flattr.com/@llucax)

[Flattr](https://flattr.com/) started as a micro-payment platform and one of the
main differentiators was you set up a monthly amount to spend on sponsoring and
then you give "flattrs" to creators. At the end of the month, all your month
money is divided by the amounts of flatts you gave and is paid out to creators.
It is a good way for supporters to have a fixed budget and reward creators
dynamically, but all of that is over and now is just a sponsoring platform with
quite high fees ðŸ˜’.

* 5% fee from Flattr + 5% fee from its payment processor + 3$ fee each time
  I want to make a withdrawal = 10%_+.
* Supports both one-time and recurring monthly payments.
* Supports free amounts.
* Micro-payments are not supported (minimum 3$).
* Payments methods: Credit card
* It requires a [Flattr](https://flattr.com/) account.
* More information: https://flattr.com/faq

Fees examples:

* You spend 3$ - I receive 2.7$ if I don't withdraw, otherwise 0$ if it's the
  only donation of the month (10%-100% fee).
* You spend 10$ - I receive 9$ if I don't withdraw, otherwise 6$ if it's the
  only donation of the month (10%-40% fee).
* You spend 100$ - I receive 90$ if I don't withdraw, otherwise 87$ if it's the
  only donation of the month (10%-13% fee).
